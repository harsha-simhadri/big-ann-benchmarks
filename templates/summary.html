            <p>Results are split by distance measure and dataset. In the bottom, you can find an overview of an algorithm's performance on all datasets. Each dataset is annoted
            by <em>(k = ...)</em>, the number of nearest neighbors an algorithm was supposed to return. The plot shown depicts <em>Recall</em> (the fraction
            of true nearest neighbors found, on average over all queries) against <em>Queries per second</em>.  Clicking on a plot reveils detailled interactive plots, including
            approximate recall, index size, and build time.</p> -->
