# BigANN Challenge T3 Leaderboards

We rank participants based on 4 different but inter-related benchmarks:
* One based on recall/average precision
* One based on throughput
* One based on power consumption
* One based on hardware cost

We maintain two sets of leaderboards that rank participants on all benchmark:
* One based on a public query dataset in which participants had access during the competition.
* One based on a private query dataet for final evaluation.

Please consult the main [T3 track README](README.md) for more details about benchmarks and ranking methodology.

## Public Dataset Leaderboard

The leaderboard on the public dataset set is [here](LEADERBOARDS_PUBLIC.md).

Submissions are now *final* which means no more code, config, or index changes can be accepted.

## Private Dataset Leaderboard

All submissions are currently being evaluated using the private data sets.  Please revisit this page later for more updates.
