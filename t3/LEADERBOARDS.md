# BigANN Challenge T3 Leaderboards and Winners

We rank participants based on 4 different but inter-related benchmarks:
* One based on recall/average precision
* One based on throughput
* One based on power consumption
* One based on hardware cost

We maintain two sets of leaderboards that rank participants on all benchmarks:
* [Leaderboards based on a public query dataset](LEADERBOARDS_PUBLIC.md) in which participants had access during the competition.
* [Leaderboards based on a private query dataet](LEADERBOARDS_PRIVATE.md) in which submissions are currently being evaluated.

Please consult the main [T3 track README](README.md) for more details about benchmarks and ranking methodology.
