# BigANN Challenge T3 Leaderboards and Winners

We rank participants based on 4 different but inter-related benchmarks:
* One based on recall/average precision
* One based on throughput
* One based on power consumption
* One based on hardware cost

We maintain two sets of leaderboards that rank participants on all benchmarks:
* [One based on a public query dataset](LEADERBOARDS_PUBLIC.md) in which participants had access during the competition.
* [One based on a private query dataet](LEADERBOARDS_PRIVATE.md) currently being evaluated.

Please consult the main [T3 track README](README.md) for more details about benchmarks and ranking methodology.

## Public Dataset Leaderboards And Winners

The leaderboards and rankings on the public dataset set lives [here](LEADERBOARDS_PUBLIC.md).

We would like to congratulate all the winners of this part of the competition:
* Sourabh Dongaonkar (Intel)
* Yong Wong (NVidia)
* Akira Naruse (NVidia))

We are in the process of resolving the remaining issues and tasks.  

Upon completion, we will make these winners and rankings official.  

Please revisit this page again soon for more updates.

## Private Dataset Leaderboard Status

The status of the leaderboards and rankings on the private dataset lives [here](LEADERBOARDS_PRIVATE.md).

All submissions are currently being evaluated using the private data sets so the scores (and rankings) will likely change as evaluation proceeds  

Please revisit this page again soon for more updates.
