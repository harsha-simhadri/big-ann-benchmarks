*puck instances were run with 16GB docker mem_limit, rather than 8GB, on a machine with 16GB DRAM.
^puck instances were run with 8GB docker mem_limit, on a machine with 16GB machine. However, all puck entries crash when run with 8GB mem_limit docker limit on a machine with 8GB DRAM.
It is unclear if docker actually respects the memory limit.
